# Describe the performance of an algorithm

## Runtime Complexity

How much more processing power/time is required to run your algorithm if we double the inputs?

## Space Complexity

How much more memory is required by doubling the problem set?

# Data Structure

- Ways of organizing information with optimal "runtime complexity" for adding or removing records
- JS natively implements several data strctures. You will still be asked about "inferior" data structures.
